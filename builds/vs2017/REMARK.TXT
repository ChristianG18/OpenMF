To build `game`, you need to compile required OSG version.

VS project assumes you've set up environment variables:

OSG_INCLUDE_DIR, which should point to `<path_to_osg>\include;<path_to_osg>\build\include`
OSG_LIB_DIR,     which should point to `<path_to_osg>\build\lib`

Make sure you copy all required DLLs to be able to launch it afterwards.
